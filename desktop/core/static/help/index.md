Welcome to Hue!

Hue is a browser-based, desktop-style environment that enables you to interact with a Hadoop cluster. Hue includes several easy to use applications that help you work with Hadoop Map/Reduce jobs, Hive queries, and user accounts. The Hue applications run in a Web browser and require no client installation. Hue is also a development platform for building custom applications via the Hue SDK.   

## Displaying Help for the Hue Applications

To display the help text for each Hue application, click the links in the **Index** on the left side of the Help window.

## Starting Applications

To open the Hue applications, click the icons at the bottom of the Hue web browser window. You can double-click an icon to open a second instance of the application.

## Logging In and Out

To log out of Hue, click the **logout** link at the top left corner of the Hue web browser window, next to your user name.  When you log back in, Hue restores the application windows you had open the last time you logged out.

## Changing your Password

If authentication is managed by Hue (that is, authentication is not managed via some external mechanism), you can use the User Manager or User Admin application to change your password. For more information, see the User Manager Help.

## Seeking Help, Reporting Bugs, and Providing Feedback

The Hue team strongly values your feedback. The best way to contact us is to click the **feedback** link in the bottom left section of the Hue web browser window.

If you're experiencing transient errors (typically an error message saying a service is down), contact your system administrator first.

Every window that's rendered in Hue is typically backed by an HTTP GET or POST request sent to the server via AJAX.  If you are reporting a problem and you are familiar with web development and a tool such as Firebug, mention the request that is failing in your bug report. 

## Browser Compatibility

Hue works best in Firefox, and works well in Chrome and Safari. Internet Explorer 8 is also supported. 

## Extending Desktop

Hue supports an SDK to build new applications within the framework. If you're interested in building new applications within the framework, click the **feedback** link to contact us via the Hue-users group.

User Admin
============
<a target="UserAdmin"><img src="/useradmin/static/art/useradmin-logo.png" class="help-logo"/></a>
The User Admin lets the system administrator
create and delete users, and update their passwords
and e-mail addresses.

What's the e-mail address used for?
-----------------------------------
Certain applications will alert you by e-mail when certain actions
have occurred.  The Job Designer, for example,
e-mails you when your job has completed.

How do I change my password?
----------------------------
Hit the "gear" icon in the user admin to edit your own
user profile.  (You won't be able to edit other folks.)
Type the password twice, and hit Save!

Integrating Hue with Other Authentication
------------------------------------------------------
Your administrator may choose to configure Desktop
such that the authentication goes through a different
system (e.g., PAM, LDAP, etc.)  In this case,
you need to change your password in that system.
